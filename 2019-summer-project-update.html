        <p style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">HomeAid Houston Welcomes Carole Brady as Executive Director</p>
          
      <p>Carole Brady came to HomeAid from Family Promise of Lake Houston in Humble, Texas. She began working with homeless families and children in 1998, opening her first Network in Loveland Colorado. In addition, she became part of the National Training Team working directly with new networks across the country. After six years, Carole took the position of Mid-Atlantic Regional Director for National Family Promise in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>With the desire to once again work one-on-one with Network families, Carole accepted the position as ED of IHN of the Main Line (an affiliate program of Family Promise) and was there until 2009. She developed and trained a network of Directors throughout the U.S., and designed programs such as Real Life…Life Skills Classes, Fast Track GED’s, Higher Education opportunities and a combined budgeting program that helped build financial security and education for homeless families. These classes are currently being taught at many of the Family Promise sites.</p>

<p>As part of her responsibilities, Carole will be identifying new HomeAid construction projects with homeless care providers and working with the builder captains through the project's conclusion, expanding HomeAid's message to new audiences, and working with the HomeAid Board of Directors and leading the HomeAid staff.</p>

<p>Carole lives in Kingwood, TX with her dog Isla – who works two days a week as a therapy dog for the homeless children in the Family Promise Network. </p>

<p>       HomeAid Houston is looking forward to the fall and winter seasons as we wrap up construction projects and begin new ones. We are also pleased to be a part of a year-long celebration recognizing our national chapter, HomeAid America as they observe their 30th year anniversary. </p>

<p>HomeAid was founded in 1989 by the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Association of Southern California (BIA/SC), an affiliate of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). In 1995, HomeAid America (HAA) was created to expand the effort throughout the country. HomeAid Houston was formed in 2003 and is one of 19 chapters.

Construction has begun on a third cottage for Boys and<br> Girls Country located in Hockley, Texas</p>

        <p style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Empire Communities and HomeAid Partner on Boys and Girls Country Cottage</p>
          
<p>Eight boys will soon be moving into their brand new 8100 sq. ft. cottage that will provide each with their own bedroom for the first time in their lives. This is being made possible by the partnership between HomeAid and Empire Communities who are beginning construction on this Boys and Girls country cottage. This is HomeAid’s third cottage they have facilitated for the campus located in Hockley, Texas.</p>

<p>The cottage will also house the children’s teaching parents and is designed to instill security, warmth and a nurturing environment for as long as the children need a safe haven, many times through high school. Funding is being provided to Boys and Girls Country from the Woodforest Charitable Foundation. Rafael Casas with Empire Communities is construction manager for the project. </p>

<p>“Empire Communities is honored to take part in the ongoing expansion of the Boys and Girls Country campus,” said James Miller with Empire Communities and a HomeAid board member. “Our partnership with HomeAid Houston, a leader in the community that provides housing for those facing homelessness, is a perfect fit that will allow us to provide a well-built, safe place for these children to flourish.” </p>
 
<p>The concrete for the cottage has been poured, the plumbing is in and the framing has begun. A gathering of the children, volunteers and Boys and Girls Country staff is planned at the completion of the frame stage to share expressions of hope and inspiration by writing scriptures and quotes on the actual lumber that is the structure for the cottage walls.</p>

<p>Boys and Girls Country is a Christian home for children who come from families in crisis. The agency serves as a beacon of hope for families and their children in times of hardship, offering them a reliable home life. The Boys and Girls Country program is a non-profit that was established in 1971. The program is made up of a network of 11 cottages. The children live with a married “Teaching Parent” and any children they may have, as well as two single Teaching Parents who raise these children as their own. The campus can accommodate 88 children ages 5 to 18.</p>

<p>“The construction of this cottage is bringing so much excitement and joy to the children it will benefit,” said Carole Brady, executive director of HomeAid Houston. “Partnering with James Miller and his generous company, Empire Communities has made the construction process seamless. We can’t thank Rafael Casas and his team enough for all they are accomplishing.”</p>

        <p style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">HomeAid and First America Homes to Build Day Center for Family Promise of Lake Houston</p>
          
      <p> Family Promise of Lake Houston (FPLH), a 501 c 3 charity in Humble, will soon be able to offer a new family-oriented facility designed to provide a caring and positive environment for children and their families facing homelessness. 
</p>
<p>qIt will be a 5200 sq. ft. Day Center called Promise House that is being built by HomeAid Houston and Builder Captain First America Homes, a Division of The Signorelli Company.</p>

<p>Promise House will offer counseling and admin offices, locker rooms, bath facilities, a family room, kitchen, a child’s playroom and a dining room and library. “This Day Center’s design captures the feel of a home-like setting,” said Patrick Mayhan, president of HomeAid. “At the same time, it offers a place for families to bond and to learn how to live independently while still being able to access counseling and other services. We are excited to join First America Homes and Family Promise of Lake Houston as we near the groundbreaking in late September.” </p>

<p>Families receiving assistance from FPLH are reeling from a variety of crisis situations including fire, flood, the death of a spouse, loss of a job, an eviction, or a foreclosure of a home. Promise House will replace the existing FPLH offices and will double its current capacity. </p>

<p>“Now that we are gearing up for the official groundbreaking, it is such an exciting time to be part of this project,” said Jessica Penney, executive director of FPLH. “We are thrilled to be partnering with First America Homes and HomeAid Houston to watch this dream come to reality. The Promise House will create so much opportunity for Family Promise of Lake Houston to better support the local community.”</p>
  
<p>Additional funders to the project include The William Stamps Farish Fund, Albemarle Foundation, Ascentium Capital and Avis Charitable Foundation. FPLH is also receiving funding from the PetSmart Charitable Foundation, who will pay for a “pet condo” on the property, allowing families to keep their pets as they work to improve their situation. The grant is part of a national agreement with the Family Promise organization.</p>

<p>Clearing of the land began in May and is now completed. The addition of utilities and the construction of the retention pond, driveway, parking and the PetSmart Condo will begin in late August. </p>

<p>HomeAid is partnering with Sandcastle Homes to make improvements to a 950 sq. ft. house that is being converted into an office and counseling center for Agape Development. The enhancements will provide a more modern space for day- to- day operations and provide a place for work placement assistance and counseling for the young men and women working with Agape.</p>

<p>Sandcastle Homes, led by Nicole Keown is tackling the project as part of their commitment to improving the lives of young men and women in the Third Ward. Work includes new drywall, paint, flooring and adding cabinets and lighting, and finishing a powder room.</p>

<p>With its location within Houston’s historic Third Ward, the faith based Agape Development’s Gateway Houses are part of a residential program to help 18-25 year olds make the transition to healthy adulthood by assisting with housing, utilities, food and transportation while providing counseling, job preparation and guidance in continued education. </p>
 
<p>“The goal is to assist young adults on the path to becoming independent healthy adults who are not only able to support themselves through gainful employment, but are also able to support their community through volunteering, church membership, and active community involvement,” said Carole Brady, executive director of HomeAid. “We can’t thank Sandcastle Homes and Nicole Keown enough for the hard work they’ve put into this vital part of the agency’s services.”</p>

<p>Completion is expected in late August.</p>

<p>Over the past 15 years, HomeAid Houston has worked in partnership with dozens of GHBA members to provide remodeling and small construction services to area homeless care agencies that are called HomeAid Care Projects.</p>

<p>HomeAid partnered for a second time with the Greater Houston Builders Association Remodelers Council (RMC) and Custom Builders Council (CBC) on a project for Crossroads, a Christian organization committed to promoting the health, hygiene and dignity of individuals experiencing chronic homelessness and poverty in southeast Houston.</p>

<p>This new project is moving and reinstalling four portable shower units that are an enclosure for pre-fab shower stalls to a new location at St. Paul’s/San Pablo’s Episcopal Church on Park Place Dr. These units were originally built in 2018 and refurbished by the RMC and CBC team. The new work will also include helping to establish a sewer tap and water meter on the property for the agency. Jim Holcomb with Holcomb Properties, a long-time supporter of HomeAid and the Greater Houston Builders Association donated funds toward the reinstall.</p>

<p>“Beginning in 2001, volunteers at Crossroads created a safe haven where they serve lunch, provide showers, wash clothes and work to restore dignity to those living on the streets,” said Patrick Mayhan, president of HomeAid. “HomeAid is proud to be represented by the volunteers from the RMC and CBC who partner with us year after year on these valuable projects that change lives. Thank you to all the Builder Captains and those who go unmentioned.” 
</p>
<p>Crossroads serves on average 400 individuals each week who are homeless or simply living in poverty. The program and services have grown from providing immediate basic needs to assisting participants in finding housing, employment, counseling and healthcare.</p>
